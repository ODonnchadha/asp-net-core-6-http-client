## Accessing APIs Using HttpClient in .NET 6

- UNDERSTANDING INTEGRATION WITH AN API USING HTTPCLIENT:
  - .NET 6. C# Version 10.
  - [Demo application](https://github.com/KevinDockx/AccessingAPIsWithHttpClientDotNet6)
    - Fully functioning sample and starter files for my Accessing APIs with HttpClient in .NET 6 course.

  - Strategies for working with DTOs:
    - SHARED MODEL PROJECT:
      - Diminishes code duplication. Changes are only applied in one place.
      - Useful when you want to deploy the model assembly idependently.
      - Requires control over API and associated client(s.)
      - BOTH must target supported platforms.
    - LINKED FILES:
      - Diminishes code duplication. Changes are only applied in one place.
      - Requires control over API and associated client(s.)
      - BOTH must target supported platforms.
    - What if you don't have control over the API?
      - Another technology? Another team?
    - Generating DTOs:
      - Modern-day generation relies on a machine-readable description of the API.
      - e.g.: OpenAPI. (Swagger.)
      - Swagger CodeGen. Java-based. Online version. NSwagStudio. (Windows application.)
